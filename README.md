# Arduino Uno Project: DIY Home Automation System

Welcome to the Arduino Uno project for a DIY Home Automation System. This project demonstrates how to control devices remotely using an Arduino Uno, a relay module, and basic electronics.

## Project Overview

This project showcases how to build a simple home automation system using the Arduino Uno. The system enables you to:
- Control home appliances (like lights or fans) using physical buttons or remote commands.
- Implement basic automation features for convenience and energy saving.

You can watch the project demonstration here: [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/nY7cTv8nreg).

## Components Required
- **Arduino Uno** (1 unit)
- **Relay Module** (2 or more channels, depending on the number of appliances)
- **Push Buttons** (for manual control)
- **LEDs** (optional, for status indication)
- **Power Supply** (for Arduino and relays)
- **Connecting Wires** and **Breadboard**

## Features
- Manual control of devices using push buttons.
- Automated control via programmed Arduino logic.
- Expandable design to control multiple devices.
- Low-cost and beginner-friendly.

## Circuit Diagram
Refer to the YouTube video for a detailed explanation of the circuit setup.

## How to Build
1. **Set Up Hardware**:
   - Connect the relay module to the Arduino Uno.
   - Wire the push buttons to digital pins on the Arduino.
   - Connect appliances to the relay module.

2. **Write and Upload Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Use the provided code or write your own to control the appliances.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

3. **Test the System**:
   - Press buttons to toggle the devices on/off.
   - Observe the relay module and LEDs (if connected).
